# Abstract

A preliminary base-case model in Stock Synthesis 3.30 for North Pacific (NP) swordfish (*Xiphias gladius*) is described for consideration as the 2023 base-case model. The base-case model covers the Western and Central North Pacific north of the Equator and the Eastern Pacific Ocean north of 10°N from 1975 to 2021. It includes data from three International Scientific Committee for the Conservation of Tuna and Tuna-like Species (ISC) countries and other countries in aggregate from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). This paper describes the data available for inclusion and the proposed base-case model. The model converges and appears to fit the data well. Initial diagnostics do not indicate major problems. Preliminary results suggest the North Pacific swordfish stock is being not fished above F~MSY~ and spawning stock biomass is above SSB~MSY~.

# Introduction

The International Scientific Committee for the Conservation of Tuna and Tuna-like Species (ISC) Billfish Working Group (BILLWG) has proposed to run a benchmark assessment on North Pacific swordfish (*Xiphias gladius,* SWO). Data were compiled from the International Scientific Committee for North Pacific Tuna and Tuna-like Species (ISC) member countries and other Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) countries. Countries were asked to contribute catch, CPUE, and size-frequency data. It was decided to run the assessment using a sex-specific model in Stock Synthesis version 3.30.20 (Methot and Wetzel, 2013) with fleets-as-areas spearating the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) region from the Western and Central North Pacific (WCNPO) region, as defined in the December 2022 BILLWG meeting. The available data and the preliminary model results and diagnostics for a base-case model will be presented in this document for consideration at the ISC BILLWG SWO stock assessment meeting.

# Methods

## Spatial Temporal Structure

Data were compiled by region assuming a two region model of the North Pacific Ocean with boundaries based upon those detailed in Ichinokawa and Brodziak (2008) with the modification that the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) region ends at 10°N (@fig-stockareas). Countries were asked to contribute catch, CPUE, and length frequency data partitioned by these two regions so that the North Pacific could be modeled with two implicit areas using fleets as areas. The working group agreed to start model in 1975.

Spatial structure is treated implicitly using fleets as areas.](2023_SWO_stock_boundary.png){#fig-stockareas fig-alt="Map of the three stock areas for Pacific Swordfish"}

## Definition of Fisheries

Data are available for fourteen different fleets in the WCNPO: 14 catch time series, with some fleets split into early and late periods and 8 CPUE indices of which one is a recruitment index. The fleet names and numbers are detailed in Table 1. The data available for each fleet is in @fig-dataplot. The acronyms in the fleet names are defined as follows: WCNPO is Western and Central North Pacific Ocean; EPO is Eastern Pacific Ocean; OSDWLL is offshore distant water longline; OSDWCOLL is offshore distant water and coastal longline; early is the early time period; late is the late time period, Area1 and 2 are the Japanese fishery areas in the WCNPO as defined in Ijima 2022; OSDF is offshore driftnet gear; CODF is coastal driftnet gear, JPN_WCNPO_Other is Japanese small-scale coastal longline vessels which are not under obligation to submit logbook data, bait, and net fishing gear; DWLL is distant water longline gear, TWN_WCNPO_Other is Taiwanese offshore longline, coastal longline, gillnet, harpoon and other gears; LL is longline gear; shallow is the Hawaii shallow-set sector; deep is the Hawaii deep-set sector; GN is gillnet gear; US_WCNPO_Other is harpoon and other gears; WCPFC is other WCPFC and IATTC longline gear in the WCNPO; IATTC is longline gear in the EPO north of 10ºN.

## Catch

Some of the time series of catch were divided into early and late periods to coincide with divisions of the CPUE indices (Table 1, @fig-catchplot). Three ISC countries contributed catch time series: Japan, Taiwan, and the US. In addition, catch from countries reporting to the WCPFC and IATTC were obtained from each RFMO, respectively. The CV for catch was set to 0.05 for all fleets. Catch for fleets with only annual data were divided equally into each quarter.

## Relative Abundance Indices

Each of the eight CPUE time series were assigned to a quarter based upon the recommendations of the country providing the index and are assumed to represent the quarter in which the highest catches take place for each fishery. Japanese longline fleets (S1-4) were all assigned to quarter 1; Taiwanese longline fleet (S5) was assigned to quarter 3; US longline deep-set (S7) was assigned to quarter 2, and US longline shallow-set (S8 and S9) were assigned to quarter 1. US longline deep-set fleet S6 was included as an index of recruitment because the fishery catches large numbers of young-of-the-year fish (Fleet type 31, Bohaboy and Sculley, 2023). The CPUE indices were assumed to be linearly proportional to biomass where catchability (*q*) was assumed to be constant and occur in the first month of the quarter assigned.

The CVs for each CPUE index were assumed to be equal to their respective calculated SEs on the log scale. The minimum CV was scaled to a minimum of 0.20 or the root-mean-square error (RMSE) (i.e., square root of the residual variance) of what we would expect the assessment model to fit the CPUE index best by adding a constant to each CV value. This was calculated as the square root of the residual variance of a loess smoother fit to each index (Francis 2011, Lee et al., 2014).

$$RSME_{smoother} = \sqrt{(1/N)\sum_{t=1}^{N}(Y_{t}-\hat{Y_{t}})}$$

where *Y*~t~ is the observed CPUE in year *t* on the log scale, $\hat{Y}$ is the predicted CPUE in year *t* from the smoother fit to the data on the log scale, and *N* is the number of CPUE observations. RMSE values for each index are listed in Table 2. If the input SE was greater than these values, it was left unchanged.

## Length Composition

Length composition data were available for six WCNPO fleets and two EPO fleets (@fig-lengthdataplot). Length composition data were available in quarterly time steps. Quarters with fewer than 15 total samples were removed from the time series due to limited sample size, as agreed upon by the modeling sub-group. In addition, the length composition data for F5 were excluded as they were sparse. Data were fit using a multinomial error structure. Length composition data were weighted based upon the Francis (2011) method. Input effective sample size was estimated as the total number of fish measured in each year-quarter divided by 10, with any year-quarter over fifty set to fifty to reduce the influence of large sampling events. Then, weighting was attempted based upon the T.A1.8 equation (Francis 2011) as calculated by the model using r4ss, an R package for plotting SS results (R version 3.4.0, R Core Team, 2017, r4ss version 1.28.0, Taylor et al., 2017). Length composition data were only down-weighted if the model suggested it, otherwise the fleets were not adjusted. The only fleet to be down-weighted using the Francis methods was F9, the US deep-set LL data.

## Initial Base-case Model Description

The assessment was conducted with Stock Synthesis (SS) version 3.30.20.00 released 09/30/2022 using Otter Research ADMB 13.0 (Methot and Wetzel 2013). The model was set up as a single area model with two sexes and four seasons (quarters) with fleets as areas. Spawning was assumed to occur in May (month 5) while recruitment was assumed to occur in July (month 7). Age at recruitment was calculated based upon the model estimated average selectivity at age based upon the quarterly selectivity at length. The maximum age of swordfish was set to 15 years. Sex specific biological parameters were used, with sex- and age-specific natural mortality (Table 3) as agreed upon in the BILLWG data preparatory meeting (ISC Billfish WG 2023). In addition, the CV of the growth curve was set to 0.1 for small males and females and 0.15 for large males and females, and the sex ratio at birth was assumed to be 1:1. The model used a Beverton-Holt spawner-recruit relationship with steepness (h) fixed at 0.9 and sigmaR (σ~r~) initially fixed at 0.6 and rescaled to 0.42 based upon the model suggestion.

Twenty-seven fleets were included in the model: 19 catch fleets and 8 survey fleets. Initial equilibrium catch was estimated for 1974.

Main recruitment deviations were estimated from 1985-2021, as this is the period during which there are size composition data. The recruitment deviations were bias-adjusted based upon the estimates from Methot and Taylor (2011) provided from the model results. No bias adjustment was applied to recruitment deviations from 1965-1967. 1967-1995 was the "ramp-up" period where the bias adjustment of σ~r~ was 0 at the beginning of the period and increased linearly to the maximum bias adjustment 0.94 in 1995. Full bias adjustment was from 1995-2021. The early period of recruitment deviations represents a data-poor period where there is little information to drive recruitment. The main recruitment period represents a data-rich period where there is enough data to drive the bias-adjustment of the recruitments. The ramp up period allows for a gradual ramp up of the bias-adjustment between the data-poor and data-rich periods.

The population model and the fishery length data had 51 five cm length bins from 10-260+ cm. The population had 16 annual ages from age 0 to 15+. There were no age data. Fishery length data were used to estimate selectivity patterns which controlled the size distribution of the fishery removals. All fleets with length data were estimated as six parameter double normal (dome-shaped) selectivity patterns. Survey selectivity patterns mirrored their respective catch fleets (Table 4). Estimating parameters six of the double normal selectivity pattern for F9 resulted in an improved fit to the size composition data for that fleet.

Model estimated time series of total biomass (B in metric tons, mt = 1000 kg), age 1+ total biomass (B~1+~ mt), female spawning biomass (SSB mt) and recruitment (R in 1000s of fish) were tabulated on an annual basis. Annual exploitation rate (F) was calculated as Catch/B~1+~. Stock status indicators were calculated based upon MSY-based reference points as proxies, given that the WCPFC has not set biological or other reference points for swordfish.

## Convergence Criteria and Diagnostics

The model was assumed to have converged if the standard error of the estimated parameters could be derived from the inverse of the negative hessian matrix. Various convergence diagnostics were also evaluated. Excessive CVs (\>50%) on estimated parameters would suggest uncertainty in the parameter estimates or model structure. A gradient of \>0.001 would suggest poorly fit parameter estimates. The correlation matrix was also evaluated to identify highly correlated (\>95%) and non-informative (\<0.01) parameters. Parameter estimates hitting bounds of the prior was also indicative of poor model fit.

Several diagnostics were run to evaluate the fit of the model to the data. An Age-Structure Population Model (APSM) was used to evaluate the influence of the length composition data on the population trends (Carvalho *et al.*, 2017). The ASPM was also used to explore how each CPUE index informed the population trends by running one-off ASPMs for each index. Profiling the likelihood on R~0~, where the R~0~ is fixed at a range of values around the maximum likelihood estimate and then the likelihood is estimated, was used to identify influential data components (Lee *et al.,* 2014). A runs test was used to evaluate randomness in the residuals of the CPUE data (Carvalho *et al.,* 2021). Residual plots and plots of the observed vs expected data were examined to evaluate goodness-of-fit. Finally, a retrospective analysis and hindecast cross-validation were used to evaluate the predictive ability of the model (Carvalho *et al.,* 2021).

# Results

## Model fit

The base-case model ran in about 10 minutes, estimated 89 parameters, and had a total likelihood of 1338.75 The inverse Hessian was positive definite, which allowed for the estimation of parameter standard deviations and suggests that the model converged, and the maximum gradient component was less than 0.001. None of the parameter estimates hit a bound, two selectivity parameters had a correlation above 0.95 and no parameters had correlations below 0.01. All twenty early recruitment deviations (1965-1984) and 30 of the 37 main recruitment deviations had CVs \> 50%. Five of the 34 selectivity parameters had CVs \>50%, most of which were for the estimated width of the peak (i.e. a very small number).

Fits to the abundance indices were relatively good (@fig-S1CPUEfits - @fig-CPUErunstest). The expected CPUE trend for S5 TWN LL was relatively flat and did not fit the data well, and the observed CPUE in the last 3-5 years for S4 JPN LL area 1 declined but the expected CPUE increased. Three indices failed the runs test, S5, S6, and S8 (Figure 11). S6 is the US deep set LL fleet which is a recruitment index and not fitted as a survey index, so its fit can be ignored. S8 is the US shallow-set LL fleet in the late time period, and indicates a long term decline. Additional investigation into the CPUE indices indicate that there does appear to be some conflict between the trends for each fleet, which could be driving some of the mis-fit within the model.

Estimated selectivity for each fleet are in (@fig-SizeAggFits - @fig-EOYSelec). Fits to the length composition data were also relatively good (@fig-F1F2SizeFits - @fig-F8F9SizeFits), although there are still problems fitting the US deep-set longline data (F9).  The fit to the US size data is challenging because size distribution changes substantially seasonally, with a sharp peak of small fish entering the fishery in quarters 3 and 4 which are not observed in such large numbers in quarters 1 and 2. Attempts to separate the fleet into a quarterly fleets to estimate selectivity are ongoing but not yet successful. In addition, F1 JPN LL area 1 late and F4 IATTC both fail the runs test (@fig-SizeRunsTest).

Model estimates of age 1+ biomass show a general increase in biomass from through the entire assessment time horizon, with some periodic dips in abundance (@fig-TotalBiomass). Initial spawning stock biomass was estimated to be approximately `r round(base.model$derived_quants[which(rnames=="SSB_Initial"),2],digits=-3)` mt and virgin SSB was around `r round(base.model$derived_quants[which(rnames=="SSB_Virgin"),2],digits=-3)` mt (@fig-SSB). Annual fishing mortality is reported as the average for fish ages 1-10 (@fig-Fmort). Fishing mortality was below MSY for all years and has been decreasing generally since 1998. Recruitment deviations relatively random around the equilibrium value, with occasional strong year classes (@fig-Recruit). Current depletion, as estimated as the age 1+ biomass in 2020 compared to the virgin age 1+ biomass was estimated to be `r ExecSumInfo[[19]][which(ExecSumInfo[[19]][,2]==2021),1]`.

## Diagnostics

Profiling on R~0~ showed that the recruitment estimates were highly influential in the model results, but there was relative agreement between the CPUE indices and the length composition data on the lower bound of R0 (@fig-OverallLikelihood - @fig-SizeLikelihood). The US data (CPUE and length comp) drive the model dynamics suggesting an ln(R~0~) below 6.0, and Chinese Taipei data and Japanese size composition data suggesting an ln(R~0~) around 7. Japanese CPUE data suggest an ln(R~0~) around 6.1 (Tables 4-5).

Results from the ASPM model showed a similar population trend as the full model although the scale of the ASPM is larger than the base-case model (@fig-ASPM). This suggests that while the Catch and CPUE data do provide information for the production function, the size composition data provide information about the overall scale of the population.

Results of the hindcast with cross-validation indicate that of the five CPUE indices at the end of the assessment horizon, only the Japanese LL area 2 fleet had reasonable predictive ability (MASE = 0.85), with all other fleets MASE \> 1 (@fig-CPUEHCxval). Comparing the predictive ability of the size composition data, two fleets had good predictive ability (MASE \<0.5, F3 and F9), one had good predictive ability (MASE \<1 and \>0.5, F2) and two had poor predictive ability (MASE \<1, F1 and F7, @fig-LenHCxval).

## Conclusions

Overall, the model diagnostics do not indicate substantial misfit of the model to the data. While there remains some room for improvement in the fits to the US deep-set LL size data, this fleet is a very minor contributor to the total catch and likely would not be influential to the overall stock biomass trends. The results of the preliminary model indicate that the stock is not overfished and that overfishing is not occuring. Inclusion of the North EPO area to the model results in an increase in total biomass in the North Pacific compared to the 2018 WCNPO SWO assessment, but the results are generally consistent.
